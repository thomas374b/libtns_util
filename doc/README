INSTALLATION:

The makefile is universal and mimics features like configure does.
Just run

	make
	make install

where you unpacked it. All necessary stuff will be figured out
automatically. Development of this makefile is in constant flow 
and depends also on the availability of different architectures
to the author.

The above mentioned installation procedure does not involve any 
package management.  You can run is as normal user or as root.
In case of normal user installation prefix is your home directory.

CAVEATS:

The makefile uses heavily standard unix tools like 
make, tar, install, ls, date, grep, sed, awk ...  
¡You should have the GNU versions installed of it!
	
To build debian packages wou will also need 
svn, fakeroot, dpkg-deb, lintian

Debian packages can be installed in /usr only. Everything else
will be a policy violation for debian packages. That's why you 
have to run	
	
	make deb PREFIX=/usr
	
in order to build a deb-packet.
