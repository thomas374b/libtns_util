INSTALLATION:

The makefile is universal and mimics features like configure does.
Just type

	make
	make install

where you unpacked the sources. All necessary stuff will be figured 
out automatically. Development of this makefile is in constant flow 
and depends also on the availability of different architectures
to the author.

You can run "make install" as normal user or as root. In case of 
normal user installation prefix is your home directory. In case of
root user installation prefix will be /opt/Pantec

CAVEATS:

The makefile uses heavily standard unix tools like 
make, tar, install, ls, date, grep, sed, awk, wc, du, uname ...  
¡You should have the GNU versions installed of it!


DEBIAN PACKAGES:

If you want to create debian install packages you will need some more
tools. Install the packages  

	svn (or subversion)
	fakeroot
	dpkg-dev
	lintian 

Additionally you will need a set of my scripts. If you've got everything
just type

	export MK_DEBPKG=y
	make distclean
	make install

You will be prompted for root password for installation once the package 
has been successfully built.

Debian packages can be installed in prefix /usr only. Everything else
will be a policy violation for debian packages.
